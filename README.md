*   Keyloggers are a kind of checking to program intended to record keystrokes made by a user. Perhaps the most seasoned type of digital danger, these keystroke loggers record the data you type into a site or application and ship it off back to an outsider.
*   This is a python program which captures the key which means when the user clicks a key it is being logged into a text file.
*   In this program text file is named as `key_logger_log.txt` and we are using it in append mode.
*   After every `10` keystrokes the key is being written in the txt file.
*   We have replaced the `space` key with a blank space.
## Requirement
*   For this project we need to install a python library called`pynput`
## Installation
```python
pip install pynput
```
## Run
### Manual Installation and running the file
